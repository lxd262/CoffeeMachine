# Coffee Machine Project
This is my Coffee Machine Project on JetBrains Academy. The project consists of the coffee machine and auxiliary files.

## Coffee Machine
The coffee machines repeatedly ask users for input, there are three kinds of actions user can perform. The user can buy a cup of coffee, refill the coffee machine or take all the money in the coffee machine.
There are three kinds of coffee the user can choose in the buy menu, each requires different amount of water, milk and coffee beans. The machine will check if it has enough resources before making the coffee. If it doesn't, the machine would notify user which material is insufficient. If the machine has all resourses, it would make the coffee and tell the user.
In the buy stage, the user can also type back to go back to main menu.
Once user input exit, the program will terminate.

## Auxiliary Files
These files helps me learn more about python!
